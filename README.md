I got the idea for this project when I finally convinced my grandmother to let me hire someone to help her upkeep her house.
We couldn't find a similar website for where she lives, so I thought it would be cool to build something like this.
Right now it's mostly a prototype, so the "skeleton" is working (ui, apis, databse) but I want to make things a bit more visually appealling soon.
